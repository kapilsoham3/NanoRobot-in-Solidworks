# NanoRobot-in-Solidworks
I have been really interested in Nanorobots and so to learn more, I created a nanorobot in Solidworks and 3D printed it using an Ultimaker 3 using ABS plastic. The final result was a tiny prototype of a Nanorobot. 

# Purpose
This nanorobot is used for complex localized interaction for early detection of cancer and other fatal diseases and targetted drug delievery. This robot consists of a cargo bay, a processor, gaspers and sensors 

# Cargo Bay/ Processor
This chamber is used for holding a drug payload. For cancer research, this will be used to store chemotherapy agents but it could be used for other purposes to. Apart from holding the drug payload, it also contains computation and controls system

# Graspers
The nanorobots have little legs which grip a target cell for localized treatment. The robot must be stabalized against the blood flow before deploying a treatment. 

# Sensors
If you look at the nanorobot, you will notice a mesh of wires. These are actually nano-wires acting as molecular sensors. These sensors are used to detect chemical signals and can be used to detect tumor's pH levels or specific protiens. This is extremely helpful for detecting early signs of illness. 

# Making the robot
This robot was first created in SolidWorks and then saved as an STL file. It was then uploaded to Ultimaker Cura, where the dimentions were changed so that it could be printed in 20 minutes or less. Lastly the G-code file was uploaded to the Ultimaker 3 Printer where the model was printed using ABS plastic. 

# Conclusion
Thank you for reading about this project. While the Solidworks CAD design was lost, I have uploaded the STL file and an image of the Nanorobot that you can view.
